  "name" : "Common Map Widget API",
  "description" : "Background\nMany programs and projects create widgets that search for or manipulate data then present the results on a map. The desire is to be able to combine data search/manipulation widgets from any provider with map widgets from other providers. In order to accomplish this, a standard way for the data search/manipulation widgets to be able to communicate with the map widget is necessary. This Application Program Interface (API) is the codification of that standard. \n\nOverview\nUsing this API allows developers to focus on the problem domain rather than implementing a map widget themselves. It also allows the actual map implementation used to be chosen dynamically by the user at runtime rather than being chosen by the developer. Any map implementation that applies this API can be used. Currently, implementations using Google Earth, Google Maps V2, Google Maps V3, and OpenLayers APIs are available, and others can be written as needed.\nAnother benefit of this API is that it allows multiple widgets to collaboratively display data on a single map widget rather than forcing the user to have a separate map for each widget so the user does not have to learn a different map user interface for each widget.\nThe API uses the OZONE Widget Framework (OWF) inter-widget communication mechanism to allow client widgets to interact with the map. Messages are sent to the appropriate channels (defined below), and the map updates its state accordingly. Other widgets interested in knowing the current map state can subscribe to these messages as well.\n\nalso available on https://software.forge.mil/sf/frs/do/viewRelease/projects.jc2cui/frs.common_map_widget.common_map_widget_api",

Package the provider content into a CDR 1.0 formatted retrieve result and return it to the consumer\n \nThe ADL CDR Components include a programmer Software Development Kit (SDK). The SDK includes the framework, sample code, and test driver for developing Retrieve Components with a SOAP interface conforming to the Agency Data Layer CDR Components implementation of the CDR 1.0 Specifications.\n \nNote that this is an abstract service definition and it is expected that it will be instantiated multiple times on multiple networks and in multiple systems.

However, if the execution of the actions is not recorded, it becomes impossible to recognize later the pattern that confirms the occurrence of an attack.  In a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), Web services dynamically bind to one another, making it even more difficult to recognize these patterns across Web services and determine accountability in a service chain.  Audit and Accountability is the capability that logs these events at each Web service so that these patterns can be identified, after the fact, and accountability enforced.\n\nIn support of enterprise behavior within the DCGS Family of Systems (FoS), this technical design document was created by the DCGS Enterprise Focus Team (EFT) to provide guidance for audit and accountability of the DCGS Enterprise Service Dial Tone (SDT) layer for use by the DCGS Enterprise Community at large.  It includes the capability architecture design details, conformance requirements, and implementation guidance.  DCGS service providers will use this guidance to generate security audit logs to enforce accountability in a service chain.\n\nContent of Audit Logging (SOAP) CDP:\n - Technical Design Document (TDD)\n - Service Specification Package (SSP) for each service - Not applicable\n - Conformance Test Kit (CTK) - Currently under development",

  "description" : "(U//FOUO)  This CDP provides the technical design description for the SensorWeb capability of the Distributed Common Ground/Surface System (DCGS) Enterprise Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Common layer.  \n\n(U//FOUO)  SensorWeb is a development effort led by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) National Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) Office (NMO) that aligns native sensor data output to open standard data formats in order to improve sensor data discoverability and to increase interoperability between sensor technologies, analytical tools, and Common Operating Environments (COE). \n\n(U//FOUO)  SensorWeb architecture is based on the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC?) suite of Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards and practices: specifically, the Sensor Observation Service (SOS) Interface Standard 2.0 and the Sensor Planning Service (SPS) Interface Standard 2.0.  This TDD outlines the SOS and SPS and describes how they are used in the SensorWeb reference implementation.\n(U//FOUO)  The SensorWeb reference implementation can be combined with other SOS servers to cover a wider range of sensor systems, or it can be used as a stand-alone to observe a limited area or slate of sensors.\n\n(U//FOUO)  The objective of the SensorWeb is to leverage existing data standards and apply them to MASINT sensors and sensor systems.  MASINT sensors cross a broad spectrum of collection types and techniques, including radar, sonar, directed energy weapons, and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear incident reporting.  SensorWeb ingests sensor data from its earliest point of transmittal and aligns that raw sensor output to established data standards.  SensorWeb outputs sensor data in Keyhole Markup Language (KML) format, making sensor data readily available in near real-time to systems that support KML, such as Google Earth.\n\n(U//FOUO)  SensorWeb provides unified access and control of disparate sensor data and standardized services across the ISR Enterprise, as well as delivers Command and Control (C2)/ISR Battlespace Awareness through a visualization client(s).\n(U//FOUO)  The SensorWeb Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) ingests raw data from multiple sensor systems and then converts the data to OGC standardized schemas which allows for sensor discovery, observation, and dissemination using common, open source data exchange standards.\n\n(U//FOUO)  SensorWeb was established to determine a method and means for collecting and translating MASINT sensor data output and aligning that output with open standards supported by the OGC, the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C), the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) directives.\n\n(U//FOUO)  The models, encodings, and services of the SWE architecture enable implementation of interoperable and scalable service-oriented networks of heterogeneous sensor systems and client applications.  In much the same way that Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) standards enable the exchange of any type of information on the Web, the OGC?s SWE initiative is focused on developing standards to enable the discovery, exchange, and processing of sensor observations, as well as the tasking of sensor systems.\n\nContent of Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) CDP:\n - Technical Design Document (TDD)\n - Service Specification Package (SSP) \n - Conformance Test Kit (CTK) \n    - Conformance Traceability Matrix (CTM)\n    - Test Procedure Document - Under development\n    - Test Request Messages - Under development\n    - Gold Data Set - Under development\n    - Conformance Checks Scripts - Under development",

  "description" : "Access Control incorporates an open framework and industry best practices/standards that leverage Web Services Security (WSS) [17] standards, also referred to as WS-Security, to create a common framework using Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC). The DCGS Enterprise advocates an ABAC model as the desired vision to provide policy compliance and accountability throughout the entire enterprise. To enforce ABAC, identification and authentication is executed on the service consumer and access control is enforced by the service provider. \n\nIdentification is the process in which the identity of either a user or system is established. Authentication is the process by which an entity proves a claim regarding its identity to one or more other entities. Together, identification and authentication allows a system to securely communicate a service consumer?s identity and related security attributes to a service provider. With increased sharing across programs of record and external partners, identification and authentication is crucial to ensure that services and data are secured. The successful authentication of a subject and the attributes assigned to that subject assist in the determination of whether or not a user will be allowed to access a particular service. \n\nIdentification and authentication joined with access control enforcement provide for the Access Control capability, which is critical for meeting Information Assurance (IA) requirements for those services targeted for the Global Information Grid (GIG). Access control is the process that allows a system to control access to resources in an information system including services and data. Services, supporting the DCGS Enterprise, will be made available to users within and between nodes. It is important that these services and their resources are adequately protected in a consistent manner across the DCGS Enterprise. Services are intended to be accessible only to authorized requesters, thus requiring mechanisms to determine the rights of an authenticated user based on their attributes and enforce access based on its security policy.",

  "name" : "DI2E RESTful CDR Search Technical Profile",
  "description" : "This profile provides the technical design description for the RESTful Search web service of Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E). The profile includes capability architecture design details, implementation requirements and additional implementation guidance.  DI2E Enterprise service providers and clients will use this design to support enterprise standards while creating search services within their nodes. \n\nThis document extends the IC/DoD REST interface encoding specification for Content Discovery and Retrieval (CDR) Search [CDR-RS] . It defines an interface to which a search service implementation and a subsequent deployment must conform.\n\nThe search service provides the ability to search for contents within the DI2E Enterprise with two primary functions: search and results paging. Analysts require the flexibility to search data stores in a myriad of combinations. For example, a user may perform a search for records with the keyword ?Paris? occurring between ?January 16, 2009 and January 21, 2009?; a user may perform a search for records with the keyword ?airport? and a geo location. The previous examples highlight the three different types of queries that MUST be supported by a search service implementation: \n? Keyword query with results containing the specified keyword or keyword combination\n? Temporal query with results within the specified temporal range\n? Geographic query with results within the specified geographic area\n\nThe search service provides a standard interface for discovering information and returns a ?hit list? of items. A search service?s results are generally resource discovery metadata rather than actual content resources. In the context of search, resource discovery metadata generally refers to a subset of a resource?s available metadata, not the entire underlying record. Some of the information contained within each search result may provide the information necessary for a client to retrieve or otherwise use the referenced resource. Retrieval of the product resources associated with each entry in the ?hit list? is discussed in the DI2E RESTful Retrieve profile.\n\nContent of DI2E RESTful CDR Search Profile:\n - Technical Design Document (TDD)\n - Service Specification Package (SSP) for each service - Not applicable.  Since this CDP only contains one service, contents of SSP are rolled into the TDD.\n - Conformance Test Kit (CTK)\n    - Conformance Traceability Matrix \n    - Test Procedure Document\n    - Test Request Messages \n    - Gold Data Set \n    - Conformance Checks Scripts",

  "description" : "The Extensible Mapping Platform (EMP) is a US Government Open Source project providing a framework for building robust OWF map widgets and map centric web applications. The EMP project is currently managed by US Army Tactical Mission Command (TMC) in partnership with DI2E, and developed by CECOM Software Engineering Center Tactical Solutions Directorate (SEC) . EMP is intended to be used and contributed to by any US Government organization that falls within the ITAR restrictions placed on the software hosted at this location. Current contributors include National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and ICITE-Cloud INSCOM/DCGS-A with growing interest across the defense and Intelligence communities. EMP evolved from the US Army Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) initiative. The term CPCE is still used in many areas and there is a CPCE targeted build that is produced from EMP to meet the CPCE map widget and API requirements. The great news about EMP is that it is not limited to the CPCE specific build and feature set. EMP is designed to be customized and extended to meet the needs and schedule of any organization.\n\nMap Core:\nThe map core is pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that can be embedded in any web application. The primary target for this currently is an Ozone Widget Framework (OWF) map widget, however the core code will function outside of OWF and can be used in custom web applications. When running in OWF the map core can handle all CMWA 1.0 and 1.1 messages as well as the capabilities included in the EMP JavaScript API library.\n\nAdditional Links\nhttp://cmapi.org/\nhttps://project.forge.mil/sf/frs/do/viewRelease/projects.dcgsaozone/frs.cpce_mapping_components.sprint_18_cpce_infrastructure_er",

  "description" : "The GAPS Scenario Service is a SOAP based interface into the GAPS UDOP creation, execution and publishing mechanism.  The Scenario Service allows an external entity to perform Machine to Machine (M2M) calls in order to create and execute UDOPs.  This interface can be used to integrate with other systems in order to provide geospatial visualization to give contextual SA to end users.\n\nGAPS Scenarios are defined as data packages which are stored within the GAPS Repository. The GAPS Repository Service is a SOAP based interface into the GAPS Repository which stores and maintains UDOP scenarios and geospatial products from GAPS data sources.  The Repository Service additionally creates a series of DDMS metacards to describe all of the UDOPs and artifacts stored within the GAPS Repository.  These metacards can be further published to other metadata catalogs to facilitate discovery of GAPS UDOPs and aggregated data products.\n\nA Scenario consists of a UDOP template document, products generated from a UDOP template and metadata gathered from data sources during the execution of a UDOP template.   For example, a SKIWeb scenario would consist of a UDOP template that captures information about an event (location, time, description) and other data overlays to give it a spatio-temporal context, JPEG screenshots taken automatically at different view scales for the event on a globe, a movie file with animation for temporal data, a VDF file, a KML file to execute the UDOP in Google Earth, a timeline view and all of the metadata captured during the UDOP execution.\n\nThe following are the Service Endpoints on SIPR and JWICS.

  "description" : "The Applications Development Cookbook is designed as an overview of principles and best practices for Web Application Development, with a focus on new web and related technologies & concepts that take full advantage of modern browser capabilities. The ideas introduced in this document are not intended to be all inclusive, instead, they are met to expose the reader to concepts and examples that can be adapted and applied to a broad array of development projects and tangential tasks. The content is structured so that a reader with basic technical skills can garner a high-level understanding of the concepts. Where applicable, more detailed information has been included, or identified, to allow further examination of individual areas. \n\nThis initial document is structured around four subject areas: JavaScript, User Experience (UX), HTML5, and Elastic Scalability. Each section provides a description, and then introduces key concepts[1]. \n\nJavaScript - this section provides a concise review of the main impediments developers with a few years of experience struggle with when using JavaScript. The resources section directs less experienced users to references that will teach them basic JavaScript. \n\nUser Experience (UX) ? this section provides a general overview of what UX is, as well as why and how it should, and can, be applied to application development projects. The content in this section has broad applicability, as it can inform decisions across a large spectrum: from aiding developers in designing more appealing applications to assisting managers in assuring they have marketable products. \n\nHTML5 ? the HTML5 portion of the cookbook provides developers unfamiliar with the proposed standards of the newest iteration of Hypertext Markup Language an introduction to key concepts. The section includes simple exercises to demonstrate utility. \n\nElastic Scalability ? the Elastic Scalability section provides an introduction to architecture principles that can help ensure an infrastructure is capable of meeting a modern web browser?s demands in accomplishing tasks traditionally held in the realm of the thick client.",

  "name" : "JC2CUI Common 2D Map API Widget",
  "description" : "This is a map widget developed by JC2CUI that conforms to the Common Map API - see below for more information on the API.\n\nUsing this API allows developers to focus on the problem domain rather than implementing a map widget themselves. It also allows the actual map implementation used to be chosen dynamically by the user at runtime rather than being chosen by the developer. Any map implementation that applies this API can be used. Currently, implementations using Google Earth, Google Maps V2, Google Maps V3, and OpenLayers APIs are available, and others can be written as needed.\n Another benefit of this API is that it allows multiple widgets to collaboratively display data on a single map widget rather than forcing the user to have a separate map for each widget, so the user does not have to struggle with a different map user interface for each widget. The API uses the OZONE Widget Framework (OWF) inter-widget communication mechanism to allow client widgets to interact with the map. Messages are sent to the appropriate channels (defined below), and the map updates its state accordingly. Other widgets interested in knowing the current map state can subscribe to these messages as well. It is worth noting that the map itself may publish data to these channels on occasion. For example, a map.feature.selected message may originate from a widget asking that a particular feature be selected or because a user has selected the feature on the map. While in most instances the map will not echo back another message to confirm that it has performed an operation, the map will send a view status message whenever the map view (zoom/pan) has been changed, either directly by the user or due to a view change message sent by another widget. This allows non-map widgets that wish to be aware of the current viewport to have that information without having to process all the various messages that can change its state.",

  "description" : "ESAPI (The OWASP Enterprise Security API) is a free, open source, web application security control library that makes it easier for programmers to write lower-risk applications. The ESAPI libraries are designed to make it easier for programmers to retrofit security into existing applications. The ESAPI libraries also serve as a solid foundation for new development.\n\nAllowing for language-specific differences, all OWASP ESAPI versions have the same basic design:\n* There is a set of security control interfaces. They define for example types of parameters that are passed to types of security controls.\n* There is a reference implementation for each security control. The logic is not organization?specific and the logic is not application?specific. An example: string?based input validation.\n* There are optionally your own implementations for each security control. There may be application logic contained in these classes which may be developed by or for your organization. An example: enterprise authentication.\n\nThis project source code is licensed under the BSD license, which is very permissive and about as close to public domain as is possible. The project documentation is licensed under the Creative Commons license. You can use or modify ESAPI however you want, even include it in commercial products.\n\nThe following organizations are a few of the many organizations that are starting to adopt ESAPI to secure their web applications: American Express, Apache Foundation, Booz Allen Hamilton, Aspect Security, Coraid, The Hartford, Infinite Campus, Lockheed Martin, MITRE, U.S. Navy - SPAWAR, The World Bank, SANS Institute.\n\nThe guide is produced by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) - https://www.owasp.org.",

  "name" : "VANTAGE Software Suite",
  "description" : "VANTAGE is a tactical imagery exploitation software suite. This field?proven application screens digital imagery from various tactical reconnaissance sensors and includes simultaneous support for multiple sensor types. VANTAGE provides for real? and near real?time screening of digital image data from a live data link, solid state recorder, DVD/CD, or local disk. In addition, VANTAGE provides a full featured database that can be used to quickly find imagery based on an area (or point) of interest, a time query, or sensor type.\n\n\nThis software suite allows the image analyst to receive, decompress/compress, process, display, evaluate, exploit, and store imagery data; as well as create/disseminate processed image products. VANTAGE was developed by SDL in support of various sensors such as SPIRITT, ATARS/APG-73, LSRS, ASARS-2A, SYERS-2, and Global Hawk and provides simultaneous support for multiple sensor types. \n\nThe VANTAGE software suite includes the following applications:\n\nVANTAGE ViewPoint\n     ?Provides rapid display and exploitation of tactical imagery\n     ?Displays geo-referenced digital tactical imagery in a robust, near real-time waterfall of decimated imagery\n     ?Provides on-demand display of full-resolution imagery with exploitation tools\n\nVANTAGE Ascent \n     ?Configures ground stations for device interface management (solid?state recorders, CDL interface, STANAG 4575, Ethernet feeds, etc.)\n     ?Provides sensor interfacing/processing\n     ?Performs NITF image formation\n     ?Provides for database management\n\nVANTAGE Soar \n     ?Interfaces with data received through SDL?s CDL Interface Box (CIB) or Sky Lynx for data link interfacing and simulation\n     ?Allows operator to load and play simulation CDL files, select CDL data rate, select bit error rates, perform Built?In Test (BIT), and view advanced CDL statistics\n\nVANTAGE Web Enabled Sensor Service (WESS)\n     ?Provides map-based database access via a standard web browser\n\n\nThe Vantage Web Enabled Sensor Service (WESS) is an optional service that provides access to Vantage databases from other applications. WESS The Web Enabled Sensor Service (WESS) is a server that runs on the Vantage server and exposes the Vantage database of imagery and metadata to the outside via SOAP. WESS uses an open protocol to communicate data and is not bound to a browser or programming language. The WESS client is an application that allows users to display imagery from the Vantage database in a web browser, over a network. retrieves imagery, video files, MTI files, and related products from a Vantage database over a network connection, and displays it in a web browser. If you are using Internet Explorer (IE) 9 or Firefox 3, you can also use WESS to manipulate and enhance imagery.\n\nFor more information or access to the VANTAGE Software Suite - contact David Marchant, David.Marchant@sdl.usu.edu",
