To do this it might perform anomaly detection through orthogonal subspace projection (considering each HSI pixel a vector in a multidimensional space, determining dominant spectral signatures by running a pixel clustering algorithm, creating a subspace projection operator matrix, and projecting the pixel's signature into a spectral subspace that does not contain the identified clutter signature components).",2.4.2 Evaluation (AP),"3.4.3 Receive, Store and Maintain Geospatial Product Information

48,3.3.1.1,Image Rectification,Image Rectification provides transformations to project two or more images onto a common image or geocoordinate plane.,"Rectification is a process of geometrically correcting an image so that it can be represented on a planar surface with a standard coordinate system.  This is often done to make an image geometrically conform to other images acquired from other perspectives.  This supports applications such as image/video mosaicking (combining multiple photographic images with overlapping fields of view to produce a larger, apparently seamless image), change detection, and multisensor data fusion.

It is also done to make an image or multiple images conform to a map, often for geographic information system (GIS) purposes. A common method for this service is to associate geolocations with pixels on an image.  The image pixels are then resampled to place them in into a common map coordinate system. 

Another important application in which a rectification service gets used is in performing an epipolar rectification to ensure that corresponding match points in a pair of stereo images are displaced only along a single axis.  This enables easier matching and analysis of corresponding points in stereo image pairs by reducing the pixel stereo offsets to lie entirely along a single preferred axis (the epipolar axis).

The Image rectification Service ingests at a minimum an image, and a description of the planar surface to be used in the rectification process.  In some instances, such as for epipolar rectification, the target planar surface is described entirely by a second image in a stereo pair.  Automatic point correspondence matching establishes the required rectification transformation.  In other instances, such as orthorectification, it is common to supply either a reference image and a corresponding digital elevation map (DEM) or a reference image pair such as is found in a Digital Point Positioning Data Base (DPPDB). The DEM is used in performing the rectification transformation to minimize unsightly image artifacts that can affect a rectification done on perspective images in cases where no information about underlying terrain is supplied.

These orchestrations may differ only in the instances of specific services that they use (e.g., the same service offered at different endpoints) or they may perform the same process using completely different service offerings. In a dynamic network where connectivity and QoS will vary widely over time, selecting the best orchestration from among the available options will be a complex task.

Additionally, in an environment where new services or new service instances may appear on the network frequently, it may be necessary to frequently update the orchestration to best meet the current situation.",6.2.3.8 Enterprise Application Software,8.9.5 Integrate Enterprise Applications,6.05.04 Orchestration Services,"This looks like a combination of auto-discovery and real-time continuous modeling.

For example, if a process includes a step that converts an image file from JPG format to PNG format, any service that performs this task in the orchestration must indeed perform image format conversions.

In addition, the matchmaker service ensures that each individual service is suitable for orchestration with its predecessors and successors in the orchestration based on the inputs, outputs, preconditions, and effects (IOPEs) of each service. Put simply, in order to orchestration two services, A and B, it is necessary that Service A's outputs contain all the necessary inputs for Service B, those inputs are in the proper format, all security requirements are met, etc.",6.2.3.8 Enterprise Application Software,8.9.5 Integrate Enterprise Applications,6.05.04 Orchestration Services,"Combine BPMN engines with ESBs and/or message translators..

Note that this has been one of the key areas of focus of the IC ITE effort... after much painful negotiation, a standard was agreed to by the IC community... every discrete piece of intelligence product is supposed to be tagged with a GUIDE ID at its earliest point of consumability (if not sooner!)... the GUIDE ID is an extension/variation of CIA's original implementation of this.  In particular, an IC ITE GUIDE ID has two parts: a prefix and a suffix.  The prefix is an arbitrary number that will be assigned to an Intel producing organization (agency) by the TIC (an existing ODNI group)... an agency may end up having several assigned prefix numbers, perhaps dedicated to particular product types or producing systems.  The suffix can be assigned in one of two ways. The preferred approach is to use one of the available industry standard random generators to assign a 32 hex-character number (which is usually displayed as a 36-character string, after inserting 4 hyphens, at standard locations, to break up the hex number for readability reasons), the other (optional) approach is to assign some other unique string value, with the proviso that this string has to be unique (when combined with the associated prefix value), and with the proviso that the string cannot be of substantive intelligence significance (i.e., you can't use a BE Number or some other well-known intelligence-related code, because this value, by itself, must be meaningless).

The IC is going to force Intel producers to start assigning these things, so the ScvV-4 should align with this, rather than allowing some kind of variant of this approach."

For business applications, data validation can be defined through declarative data integrity rules, or procedure-based business rules. Data that does not conform to these rules will negatively affect business process execution. Therefore, data validation should start with business process definition and set of business rules within this process. Rules can be collected through the requirements capture exercise. The simplest data validation verifies that the characters provided come from a valid set. For example, that data stored as YYYYMMDDHHMM have exactly 12 digits and  the MM is between 01 and 12 inclusive. A more sophisticated data validation routine would check to see the user had entered a valid country code, i.e., that the number of digits entered matched the convention for the country or area specified. Incorrect data validation can lead to data corruption or a security vulnerability.

The Retrieve Content service facilitates this use case through its use of WS-Addressing, but it requires a companion asynchronous callback interface to ultimately accept the routed data resource. This interface is captured by the Deliver Content  service.

The Retrieve Content service provides a common interface and behavioral model for Intelligence Community (IC) and Department of Defense (DoD) content collections, enabling content consumers to retrieve content from disparate collections across the IC/DOD enterprise.

WMS-produced maps are generally rendered in a pictorial format such as PNG, GIF or JPEG, or occasionally as vector-based graphical elements in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) or Web Computer Graphics Metafile (WebCGM) formats.  
This International Standard defines three operations: one returns service-level metadata; another returns a map whose geographic and dimensional parameters are well-defined; and an optional third operation returns information about particular features shown on a map. Web Map Service operations can be invoked using a standard web browser by submitting requests in the form of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). The content of such URLs depends on which operation is requested. In particular, when requesting a map the URL indicates what information is to be shown on the map, what portion of the Earth is to be mapped, the desired coordinate reference system, and the output image width and height. When two or more maps are produced with the same geographic parameters and output size, the results can be accurately overlaid to produce a composite map.
